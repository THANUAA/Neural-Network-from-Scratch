# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch (XOR Classification)

This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using only NumPy to classify the XOR problem. It includes manual implementation of forward propagation, backpropagation, and training.

## 🚀 Features
- 2-layer neural network built manually
- Forward + backward propagation logic
- Loss calculation using MSE
- Real-time visualization of decision boundaries

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🛠️ How to Run
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-net-xor](https://github.com/THANUAA/Neural-Network-from-Scratch.git
cd neural-net-xor
python xor_nn.py

📊 Output
